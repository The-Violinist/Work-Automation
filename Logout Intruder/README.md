# Intruder Logout
This is more or less a joke script which logs out any user who is not me. The idea came about because of legitimate work by the IT department which corrupted a co-worker's computer. The script can be set as a scheduled task which runs whenever a user logs on. Just be sure to set the allow user as yourself!

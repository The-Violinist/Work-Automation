# Popular Domain Checker
### List domains which have not been seen yet and run nslookup
This program reads all of the domains from the WatchGuard Popular Domains report and checks them against a list of known safe sites. Sites which have not been seen before are presented to the user along with the IP address to determine if it is safe.

This program must be run in the same directory as the text.txt hidden file. test.txt contains the list of already seen popular domains.

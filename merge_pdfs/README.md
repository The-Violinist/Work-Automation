# Merger

# Compile PDF files into one

This program merges files which are to be included in the final weekly report for each client. It searches the weekly folders on the network drive using a dictionary of keywords then compares them against the files which should be included for each client. There is a function which converts the cover sheet (docx) to PDF and an optional function which rotates the MAV report if needed.
